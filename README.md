# NYTinator3000
A simple Python3 script that provides the answers for a range of NYT games. 

## Currently supported:
- Wordle
- Connections
- Strands

## How does this script work?
It retrieves the .json file that stores today's solutions for the selected game from the NYT servers, parses it, and then prints out the relevant data. 

## WHy did you make this?
The script isn't anything special, I just thought it would be a bit of fun :)
I also wanted to learn more about parsing .json files with Python.
